# VuforiaSampleSwift

Vuforia sample app using Swift and SceneKit. 

This began with the boilerplate code from [yshrkt's Sample Project](https://github.com/yshrkt/VuforiaSampleSwift). Also big thanks to [interactivetech](https://github.com/interactivetech) for troubleshooting some early issues :)

## Demo

## Usage

Create `VuforiaSampleSwift/Keys.plist` and add your [Vuforia License Key](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Solution/How-To-Create-an-App-License) as follows:

```
vuforiaLicenseKey: [ Your License Key ]
```

Sorry for the rough code for now :)
